This will be a fun frontend project to delve deeper into React using Riot's api. The purpose of this project will be to learn and have fun building a front end from scratch. 

# MVP List

- User should be able to look up win rates of an index of champions.

- User should be able to click on an individual champ to bring them to a page for the champion's stats.
    - Stats include win rate and item builds for now.

- MVPS to be added as I think of more.

# Technologies to be used

  - React
  - Styled Components
  - More as needed (or depending on what I want to learn)
